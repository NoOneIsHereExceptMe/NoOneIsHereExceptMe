### 👋 Hello World! 

I'm @JackOriander, a passionate Python programmer based in India. My journey in the world of coding began with my uncle who was studying in a college at that time.
He used to make some awesome projects on his own, and I used to just watch with amazement and excitement. He taught me the basics of logic and some basic C syntax. And now I'm walking in his footsteps. I'm really happy that got to meet my awesome uncle.
